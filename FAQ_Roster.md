Just drop a `jabber.client.RosterManager` on the same form as your `jabber.client.JabberClient` (you **have** followed the directions GettingStarted to get them into your toolbox, right?) Set the Client property on the `RosterManager` to your `JabberClient` instance, and youâ€™re up and running.

However, `RosterManager` is more for local caching of your roster, and not for setting things.  If you want to modify the roster, `JabberClient.Subscribe` and `JabberClient.RemoveRosterItem` allow you to do this.
