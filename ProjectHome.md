A set of .Net controls for sending and receiving Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), also known as the Jabber.  Client connections, server component connections, presence, service discovery, and the like.

Drag a `JabberClient` control onto your design surface.  Set a few properties, double-click on the `OnMessage` event.  Call `Connect()`.  You now have an XMPP client application.

See the [FAQ](FAQ.md) before posting on the list, please.  In particular, see [FAQ\_Where](FAQ_Where.md) to find out where to get a copy of Jabber-Net.
